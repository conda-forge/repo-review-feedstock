  summary: 'This is a framework for building checks designed to check to see if a repository follows guidelines'
  description: |
    This is a framework for building checks designed to check to see if a repository follows
    guidelines. By itself, it does nothing - it requires at least one plugin to be installed.

    With one or more plugins, it will produce a list of results - green checkmarks mean this
    rule is followed, red xâ€™s mean the rule is not. A yellow warning sign means that the check
    was skipped because a previous required check failed. Four output formats are supported;
    rich, svg, html, and json.
